# FreeCodeCamp Caesars Cipher Project

This is my soution to the [Caesars Cipher project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher) on FreeCodeCamp. In it, I incorperated the use of RegEx and UTF-16 charecter codes to decode the string argument using the ROT-13 cipher.

The instructions and guidelines are here:

> Caesars Cipher
> One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also 
> known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are
> shifted by some set amount.

> A common modern use is [the ROT13 cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)
> , where the values of the letters are
> shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.

> Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a
> decoded string.

> All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character
> (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
