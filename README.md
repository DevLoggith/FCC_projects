# FreeCodeCamp Palindrome Checker Project

This is my solution to the first JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects from the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. The instructions and guidelines are here:

> Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
> 
> A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
> 
> Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.
> 
> We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as racecar, RaceCar, and race CAR among others.
> 
> We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as 2A3*3a2, 2A3 3a2, and 2_A3*3#A2.

I stared by using the technique shown in built-in.js utilizing built-in string functions to make all the modifications necessary, solely inside the palindrome() function. After looking around at some other solutions and ideas, I wanted to try my hand at creating indivdual functions for each string modification to practice writing for reusability and modularity, then incorporating those into the final worker funnction (plaindrome(str)). This is what can be found in encapsulation.js.
